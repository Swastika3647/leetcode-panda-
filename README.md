🐼 LeetCode Panda Agent
An interactive productivity companion for the LeetCode grind.

🚀 Overview
LeetCode Panda Agent is a Chrome Extension designed to serve as a "Supervisor Agent" for competitive programmers. Built while pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering at the University of Kalyani, this project aims to bridge the gap between casual browsing and focused problem-solving.

Having solved over 850 problems on LeetCode, I designed this tool to ensure that my momentum never stalls as I work toward my goal of 1000+ solves and a 2028 graduation.

✨ Features
Intelligent Nudging: The Panda appears on non-coding sites (LinkedIn, Reddit, etc.) but hides when you are on leetcode.com.

Boba-Powered Motivation: A floating, boba-drinking Panda companion that waves and reacts to your presence.

The "Guilt Trip" Timer: The Panda grows in size every 5 minutes you spend procrastinating on non-essential tabs.

Neon Glow UI: High-impact visual feedback with a neon aura and highlighted speech bubbles upon interaction.

Medium Warp: Double-click the Panda to instantly navigate to a random Medium difficulty problem.

🛠️ Tech Stack
JavaScript (ES6+): For DOM manipulation and URL tracking logic.

CSS3: Utilizing @keyframes for floating animations and filter: drop-shadow for the neon glow effects.

Chrome Extension API (Manifest V3): For seamless browser integration.
