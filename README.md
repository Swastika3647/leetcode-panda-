# 🐼 LeetCode Panda Agent

A fun, slightly judgmental Chrome extension that keeps you accountable to your **LeetCode goals**.

If you wander off to Reddit, LinkedIn, or other distractions, a panda shows up to remind you where you *should* be. When you're actually solving problems on LeetCode, the panda politely disappears.

> Productivity, but make it cute.

## ✨ Features

* 🐼 **Floating Panda Supervisor**
  Appears on non‑LeetCode websites to gently (or not so gently) guilt‑trip you back to practice.

* 🎯 **Smart Website Detection**
  Automatically hides itself on LeetCode so it never interferes with problem‑solving.

* ⏱️ **Procrastination Feedback**
  The longer you stay on distracting sites, the more noticeable the panda becomes.

* 🎨 **Minimal & Fun UI**
  Animated panda with clean CSS styling — playful but not overwhelming.

* 🚫 **No Login. No Data Collection.**
  Runs fully locally in your browser.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

LeetCode consistency is hard. Blocking sites is extreme.
This extension sits in the middle — **soft accountability**.

Instead of forcefully blocking distractions, it:

* Makes you *aware* of your procrastination
* Nudges you back toward your goal
* Keeps things lighthearted

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **JavaScript** – core extension logic
